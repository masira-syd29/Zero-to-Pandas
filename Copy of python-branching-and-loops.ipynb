You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n","\n","\n","#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n","\n","To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n","\n",">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors.

If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements within the *`if` block* are executed.

This makes Python code easy to read and understand. You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces.\n","\n","\n","For example, let's write some code to check and print a message if a given number is even."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"DnKY59MO2GBS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755498630344,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"maseera.irfansayed","userId":"13582133018521193732"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["a_number = 34"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"L_xtUAj32GBS","outputId":"8bf17a45-afad-4089-a4d7-71af8bdaa9cc","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755498631713,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"maseera.irfansayed","userId":"13582133018521193732"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["We're inside an if block\n","The given number 34 is even.\n"]}],"source":["if a_number % 2 == 0:\n","    print(\"We're inside an if block\")\n","    print('The given number {} is even.'.format(a_number))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HhsBEDQw2GBT"},"source":["We use the modulus operator `%` to calculate the remainder from the division of `a_number` by `2`.
